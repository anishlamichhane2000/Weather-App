this is the flutter intern task which the user need to fetch the data from provided api ,with location,tempreture and view. 

This code defines a weather app that displays the current temperature, condition text, and condition icon based on the user's location. The weather data is obtained from the Weather API using an API key. The app has two screens: the HomeScreen and the HelpScreen. The HomeScreen displays the weather data and allows the user to enter a location to get the weather data for that location. If the user does not enter a location, the app will use the device's GPS to obtain the current location. The HelpScreen displays a welcome message and a skip button that directs the user to the HomeScreen after a five-second delay.

The code uses the Flutter framework and the provider package for state management. The WeatherData class is a provider that stores the weather data and provides methods to fetch the data and clear it. The HomeScreen and HelpScreen classes are stateful widgets that implement the UI for their respective screens. The main function sets up the app and routes the user to the HelpScreen on initial launch.
